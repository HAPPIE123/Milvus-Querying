## Description
The **Milvus-Querying** project is a fusion of cutting-edge technologies like Python, Hugging Face, and Milvus to enable efficient querying on a database populated with details of many people including names, ages, salaries, addresses, and personal introductions. The searching capability is facilitated through Cosine-Similarity distances on IVF Flat index.
